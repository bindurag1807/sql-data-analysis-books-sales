# 🗃️ SQL Data Analysis – Bookstore Sales

A SQL-based data analysis project using a structured MySQL database for a fictional bookstore. It includes cleaned, normalized data tables and advanced queries to extract actionable business insights.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bookstore sales data through structured querying in MySQL. Raw CSV data was cleaned and converted into normalized tables for **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders**. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), it surfaces trends in revenue, customer behavior, and product performance.
